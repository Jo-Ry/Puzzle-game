# Puzzle-game using React.js, Vite and SCSS
This puzzle game is a generalized variant of the so-called 15-puzzle, as it can handle an arbitrary number of rows and columns. It is built solely as a frontend application.

**Features for this project**
* Allow users to adjust the difficulty level based on their preferences trough a config file that contains the amount of rows and columns on the board.
* Responsive.
* The tiles are numbered from 1 and upwards.
* There is exactly one empty space at all time.
* Tiles are moved by clicking on a tile in the same column or row as the empty space; then that tile and all tiles between it and the empty space move one step towards the empty space.
* Using the Google font "Open Sans".
* The initial order of the tiles are shuffled when page loads in.
* There is a button that shuffles the order of your tiles that you can press at any time during the game session.
* If the user solves the puzzle, it displayes an appropriate message on the screen.
